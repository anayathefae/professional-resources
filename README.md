A repo for keeping track of important information related to resume, CV, career


Hello!!
I am starting a repository as kind of a list of resources that I think will help me and others stay on top of career, resume, etc. 

For starters, here's a guide on putting Github on a resume!

Also, I think this might be a good idea. It's free and I think might be a good way to keep track of accomplishments to share with colleagues, recruiters, etc.
